Its original name had to be changed for copyright reasons.

The series recounts the experiences of a middle-class family, the Alc&aacute;ntaras, during the last years of the rule of Francisco Franco and the beginning of the Spanish Transition to democracy. Its name comes from a famous song by the Spanish 1960s pop group F&oacute;rmula V, titled Tell Me. The producer of the series is Miguel &Aacute;ngel Bernardeau.

The series was created to celebrate the first 25 years since Spain's transition to democracy, and its didactic spirit is clearly evident in some of the episodes. It includes documentary interviews with historical figures of the era, such as people concerned with the assassination of then prime minister Carrero Blanco and the death of Franco.

The first episode was broadcast on September 13, 2001. The series begins in April 1968 with the victory in the Eurovision song contest of the singer Massiel. The story reflects changes in Spain beginning in that year.

In December 2008, TVE and Ganga Group announced that the series, in its 10th season, had achieved very good audience levels, and would be renewed for up to 3 more seasons, with the storyline moving firmly into the 1980s and the "Movida madrile&ntilde;a".";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"2001-09-13";s:10:"popularity";d:14.7019999999999999573674358543939888477325439453125;s:12:"vote_average";d:5.79999999999999982236431605997495353221893310546875;s:10:"vote_count";i:18;}i:19;a:9:{s:2:"id";i:96815;s:5:"title";s:14:"Sex, Explained";s:11:"poster_path";s:63:"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300/nIwI7rlhVXlfDHNoLFfYzkz7TJ4.jpg";s:13:"backdrop_path";s:63:"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780/jVOuONC0ftb6INZpp1s256ZxzRf.jpg";s:8:"overview";s:141:"From the biology of attraction to the history of birth control, explore the ins and outs of sex in this entertaining and enlightening series.";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"2020-01-02";s:10:"popularity";d:20.6640000000000014779288903810083866119384765625;s:12:"vote_average";i:0;s:10:"vote_count";i:0;}}s:13:"total_results";a:1:{i:0;i:99;}}
