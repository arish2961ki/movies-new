The opening sequence for the series has remained the same throughout the decades, which remains highly unusual for any such long-running TV series up to date.

Each of the regional TV channels which together form ARD, plus ORF and SF, produces its own episodes, starring its own police inspector, some of which, like the discontinued Schimanski, have become cultural icons.

The show appears on DasErste and ORF 2 on Sundays at 8:15 p.m. and currently about 30 episodes are made per year. As of March 2013, 865 episodes in total have been produced.

The first episode was broadcast 27 June 1971 in the German Democratic Republic, and after the dissolution of Fernsehen der DDR the series was picked up by ARD. It was originally created as a counterpart to the West German series Tatort, and quickly became a public favorite.

In contrast with other television crime series, in which killings are practically the primary focus, while Tatort handled homicide cases, the cases handled in the GDR TV's Polizeiruf were more often the more frequent, and less serious, crimes such as domestic violence, extortion, fraud, theft and juvenile delinquency, as well as alcoholism, child abuse and rape. Contrary to Tatort, which concentrated on the primary characters and their private lives, police procedure was the center of attention of Polizeiruf, especially in the earlier episodes. The scriptwriters attached particular importance to representation of the criminal and his state of mind, as well as the context of the crime. Many episodes aimed to teach and enlighten the audience about what does and what doesn't constitute appropriate behaviour and appropriate thought, rather than just to entertain. Polizeiruf was one of the few broadcasts by GDR media in which the real problems and difficulties of the supposedly more advanced socialist society could be displayed and discussed to some extent, albeit in a fictionalized and pedagogicalized environment.";s:12:"release_date";s:10:"1971-06-27";s:10:"popularity";d:171.253999999999990677679306827485561370849609375;s:12:"vote_average";d:6.4000000000000003552713678800500929355621337890625;s:10:"vote_count";i:11;}i:18;a:9:{s:2:"id";i:1412;s:5:"title";s:5:"Arrow";s:11:"poster_path";s:63:"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w300/gKG5QGz5Ngf8fgWpBsWtlg5L2SF.jpg";s:13:"backdrop_path";s:63:"https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w780/dXTyVDTIgeByvUOUEiHjbi8xX9A.jpg";s:8:"overview";s:215:"Spoiled billionaire playboy Oliver Queen is missing and presumed dead when his yacht is lost at sea.
